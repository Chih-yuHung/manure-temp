# manure-temp_Fittja
This repo is to simulate the manure temperature in Fittja
	We have uploaded all of the input and simulated data, as well as the models, to our GitHub repository (https://github.com/Chih-yuHung/manure-temp). The files named "Measured manure temp_*.R" detail our approach to dealing with measured manure temperature data for temperature comparison. The files named "Organize weather data_*.R " describe the process we used to obtain climate data inputs. The "1. Main. R" file controlled the input files and generated output, including figures and statistical evaluations. The files numbered two to seven provided parameters inputs and simulated the manure temperature. To create the figures and tables in this study, we used the "Result comparison.R" and "stat output.R" files. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using the "Sensitivity.R" file.
